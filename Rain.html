                Populations around the world face a range of threats to health and wellbeing which 
                could potentially be addressed by initiatives such as community gardening. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                These threats include the non-communicable diseases and their contributory risk factors such as 
                low levels of physical activity and poor diet. Poor mental health is projected to be one of the 
                most extensive population health issues and current trends, such as the increase in factors such 
                as loneliness and poor social contact, will further exacerbate this situation.         
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Poverty and food insecurity also contribute to the burden of poor health. More broadly 
                environmental degradation (both social and physical) has also been shown to impact on health 
                and wellbeing.
